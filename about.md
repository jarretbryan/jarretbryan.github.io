Hi, my name is Jarret. I'm a technologist and web developer in training, currently learning at the Flatiron School. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Science and Technology Studies from Brown University. I'm very much interested in exploring the ways tech can further activism and social justice. I was born in NYC, raised in Brooklyn, I currently live in Harlem, and I'm subscribed to far too many podcasts.

## Projects:
Coming Soon...
