My name is Jarret and I'm a technologist and web developer in training, currently learning at the Flatiron School. I received my Bachelor of Arts in Science and Technology Studies from Brown University. I'm very much interested in exploring the ways tech can further activism and social justice. I was raised in Brooklyn, and I currently live in Harlem. I'm subscribed to far too many podcasts and I'm always looking for more. </p></div>
